# water-quality-ph-sql-project
SQL-based analysis of Massachusetts water quality (pH levels) using sample EPA-style data from Jan–Apr 2024. Includes data cleaning, aggregation, categorization, and insights aligned with environmental data systems. Built to demonstrate qualifications for an entry-level Systems Analyst role.


This graph shows the average pH levels measured at four different monitoring locations. All of the values fall within the EPA’s safe range (between 6.5 and 8.5), though one location is closer to the lower limit, which may indicate slightly more acidic conditions compared to the others. see below for the graph.

This chart shows how many water quality samples were collected at each monitoring location. Sites USGS-01010101 and USGS-01010102 had the most samples with two each, while USGS-01010103 and USGS-01010104 had just one sample each. This helps highlight which locations were monitored more frequently. See chart below.
